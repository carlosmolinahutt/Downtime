</p>

## What is it?

`treads` is a Python package to evaluate earthquake induced downtime and model recovery of buildings. This tool implements the framework presented in: 

Molina Hutt, C., Vahanvaty, T. and Kourehpaz, P. (2021). “An analytical framework to assess earthquake induced downtime and model recovery of buildings.” *Earthquake Spectra*, Accepted.

This tool is fully compatible with SimCenter’s tool for loss assessment, i.e., pelicun (https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/pelicun) 


## Installation

`treads` is available at the Python Package Index (PyPI). You can simply install it using `pip` as follows:

```
